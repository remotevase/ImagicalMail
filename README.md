# PLEASE NOTE:
**This plugin was originally designed for Pocketine 0.10.0, but no one has updated it since then. I am now updating it for ImagicalMine (will  not work on PocketMine)**

# ALSO NOTE:
**This plugin was already updated on @remotevase's local machine, and all that was left to do was to upload it to github, fix typos, and test it**

# Help Please:

** remotevase cannot test the plugin on his own because he doesn't have access to an ImagicalMine server. Can someone else please test it and submit the results in the issues section **
